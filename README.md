# Chat Room Web Application

This web application provides a platform for users to connect and communicate with others through chat rooms. Users can easily join existing chat rooms or create new ones with a unique alphanumeric code assigned by the server. Each chat message is timestamped and displayed with the sender's username. The application also features a list of current chat rooms and an about page with information about the project and its creators. You can also use these chat rooms to play a fun game of rock, paper, scissors! You can also navigate to the Minesweeper tab and play a nice game of minesweeper.
